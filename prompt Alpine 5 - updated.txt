I want from you using HTML and the TailwindCss & Alpinejs to build one-page document about: 
T-shirt

And let's call this shop
I want from you whenever there is a repetitive same SVG element I want from you to define it once (in advance) and to use it every time using it as sprite.

also add whatsapp icon for contact purpose on the right side lower corner, also go up button on the left lower corner

at the end (footer) i want something like: Website designed with â™¥ by RN Team

I also want when the user clicks on add to cart I want to actually store those information inside some kind of variable when there is something inside the cart I want some type of an icon to pop up on the right side at the middle of the screen as a floating around user to click on it and to see the cart details

----for ID
 I want from you to use an ID for anything that could be changed in terms of a dynamic content including images heading tags paragraph tags etc. so instead of this:
<p class="text-xl mb-8">Elevate your vehicle's performance and style with our premium collection of wheels
                and rims.</p>

do it like this:
<p id="about" class="text-xl mb-8">Elevate your vehicle's performance and style with our premium collection of wheels
                and rims.</p>


## Element ID Requirements for Visual Editor

I need to modify my website's HTML structure to support a visual editor that allows users to click and edit specific elements. Based on the editor code I'm implementing, elements need IDs to be selectable and editable.

### Core Requirements:

1. Add unique IDs to all editable elements including:
   Paragraphs (<p>)

Headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.)

Sections (<section>, <div class="section">)

Images (<img>)

2. Exclude the following elements from receiving IDs:
   - Elements within product details sections
   - Elements that contain dynamic/generated content (like email protection scripts)
	- Elements that are part of AlpineJS template loops

3. For example, don't add IDs to elements like:
  <p><a href="javascript:void(0)" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3d54535b527d4f5450505c4e49584f135e5250">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></p>


4. The ID naming convention should be semantic and descriptive (e.g., `hero-heading`, `about-paragraph-1`, `team-section`)

5. Ensure all IDs are unique across the entire document

6. another example for nested/decorative element:


<!-- INCORRECT -->
<div id="footer-logo" class="mb-4 md:mb-0">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Rim<span class="text-red-500">Master</span></h2>
</div>

<!-- CORRECT -->
<div class="mb-4 md:mb-0">
  <h2 id="footer-logo-text" class="text-2xl font-bold">Rim<span id="footer-logo-highlight" class="text-red-500">Master</span></h2>
</div>

The visual editor uses these IDs to identify which elements can be edited, so any element without an ID will not be selectable in the editor interface.

now in cases where there's some design decoration related element to be in the same parent i want from you instead of writing it like this:
<h1 id="logo-text" class="text-3xl font-bold">
                    Rim<span id="logo-highlight" class="text-red-500">Master</span>
</h1>
do it like this instead:
<h1 id="logo-text" class="text-3xl font-bold">
                    <span id="logo-prefix" class="text-white">Rim</span><span id="logo-highlight" class="text-red-500">Master</span>
                </h1>

this to prevent any issue while trying to select each one for editing purpose.


--- for products
I want to generate them using Alpinejs (loop),knowing that the products variable should be assigned to PRODUCTS constant like this:

            // Product data
            products: PRODUCTS,

because the PRODUCTS is actually coming from this source:
<script src="../productsTheme.js"></script>
which includes a set of products data with the following structure & syntax:


 (follow similar & exact syntax structure as this just for demo purpose):
const PRODUCTS = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Whey Protein Isolate",
    description: "High-quality protein with 27g per serving for muscle recovery and growth.",
    price: 39.99,
    rating: 5,
    image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593095948071-474c5cc2989d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Pre-Workout Complex",
    description: "Energy-boosting formula with caffeine and beta-alanine for intense workouts.",
    price: 29.99,
    rating: 5,
    image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1546483875-ad9014c88eba?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80"
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: "Minima nostrud volup",
    description: "Sed ab cillum magna",
    price: 50,
    image: null,
    rating: 0
  }
];

I want also to apply some type of search bar for those products
